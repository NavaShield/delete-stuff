# File Encryption Script

This script is used to encrypt files within specified subfolders within user folders on a Windows system.

## Requirements

- The script assumes that the user folders are located at `/mnt/c/Users` which is the location for user folders when the script is run in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- The script requires `openssl` to be installed and available in the PATH

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file on the target system.
2. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x script-file-name.sh`.
3. Run the script by executing `./script-file-name.sh` in the terminal. *Note: This script must be run in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in order to access the `/mnt/c/Users` directory.*

## Functionality

The script first defines a function to list all folders in the `/mnt/c/Users` directory. It then uses that function to get a list of folders and loops through each folder to encrypt the files within the specified subfolders (`Downloads`, `Documents`, `Pictures`, and `Videos`). 

The script generates a random password for each file and encrypts it using AES-256 encryption. The original unencrypted files are then removed.

## Output

The script outputs a message indicating whether the specified files have been encrypted successfully or if an error occurred.

## Notes

- The script does not modify the folder structure, only the contents of the specified subfolders.
- The encrypted files will have a `.enc` extension added to the original filename.
- The script does not keep a record of the generated encryption passwords. Make sure to securely store the passwords if you need to access the encrypted files in the future.
